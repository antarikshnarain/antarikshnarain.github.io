# To be updated

## Self Organizing Robots

**September 2020-Present**
Developing software simulation in Gazebo with OpenMP to arrange robots in predesigned shape. The robots communicate on a decentralized network with limited scope, maps the environment using SLAM and organize themselves using path planning algorithm.

## Estimating Arrival time for a Hydraulic Conductivity Map

**September 2020-November 2020**    [GitHub](https://github.com/antarikshnarain/Estimating-t95-HydraulicConductivityMap)
Developed parallel computation framework using OpenMP and convolutional neural network wtih keras in python and C++ to estimate t-95 for a hydraulic conductivity map. The system was trained on USC's HPC system and obtained a correlation of 81.1\%.

## Geo Linked Attachments and Tags

**January 2017-May 2017** [GitHub](https://github.com/antarikshnarain/GLAT)
Created an Android application where users can tag messages to objects in environment. These messages are retrieved based on localization of user's position and camera feed with HAAR cascades to identify tagged objects.

## Cat and Dog Classifier

**July 2016-November 2016**
Designed machine learning model using python with tensorflow to solve Kaggle problem of Cat and Dog classifier. Accuracy: 89.388\%.

## Content Recommendation for Articles

**January 2016-May 2016**   [GitHub](https://github.com/antarikshnarain/ContentRecommendationForArticles)
Designed an application in python to recommend related articles from dataset and web based on input write-up. The software uses natural language processing (using nltk) with a web crawler to search and recommend content to user.

## Gesture Recognition Interpretation and Transmission

**July 2015-November 2015**     [GitHub](https://github.com/antarikshnarain/GRIT)
Built an application on MATLAB to recognize different hand gestures and interpret input as actions or words. The software identifies handwritten words and shares it as text on the network by a messaging application. \
The system I am most proud of is the project I did during my college, Gesture Recognition Interpretation and Transmission (GRIT). We were a team of two, who started with an idea of building a simple hand writing recognition software. Because we recently learnt how to use MATLAB we decided to build the application on it. Once we started building the application we realized its potential and started working on a system that allows real time handwriting recognition and transmits it as a message. To make it more accessible we added air gestures to use the application. It was a cool project, where I learnt how to distribute workload and learnt how to collaborate and integrate different sets of modules. Also had to read beyond the books to make things work real-time and how to parallelize the application to keep the user experience as smooth as possible.

## Regulated IoT

**July 2015-November 2015**     [GitHub](https://github.com/antarikshnarain/RIoT)
Synthesized a hardware prototype to convert a normal switchboard to IoT enabled. It uses relays to supplant switches, optocoupler to replace regulator and a current sensor to calculate power usage. The web application allows users to control voltages remotely.
